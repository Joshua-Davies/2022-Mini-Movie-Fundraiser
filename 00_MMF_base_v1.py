***** Instructions *****

For each ticket, enter...
- The person's name (can't be blank)
- Age (between 12 and 120)
- Payment method (cash / credit)

when you have entered all the users, press 'xxx' to quit.

The program will then display the ticket details
including the cost of each ticket, the total cost 
and the total profit.

The information will also be automatically written to
a text file.
